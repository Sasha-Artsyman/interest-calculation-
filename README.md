the algorithm for calculating interest on a deposit depends on the amount of the deposit. The input will be given a number (the amount of the deposit). If the value is less than 100, 5% will be charged, if the value is in the range from one hundred to two hundred - 7%, if more - 10% (+ calculation of bonuses)
